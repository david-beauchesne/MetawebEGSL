# MetawebEGSL

A description of the metaweb of the species in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada.

## Species interactions

Species binary interactions are evaluated using an instance-based machine learning algorithm using species similarity to inform predictions (Beauchesne *et al* 2016; Life & Environment, 66(3-4): 333-342). Functions are available through the [`iEat`] (https://github.com/david-beauchesne/iEat) package.

## Species list

A full checklist of species and taxonomic information is available from the [Canadian Register of Marine Species (CaRMS)](http://www.marinespecies.org/Carms/), a Canadian offshoot of the [Worls Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)](http://www.marinespecies.org). We adapted this list to include missing marine mammals, marine birds and invasive species.

The list of species considered for inclusion in the metaweb comes from a collection of dataset from which we have distributional data throughout the region. The datasets used come mainly from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and are available through various environmental monitoring programs such as fisheries logbooks (DFO 2018) and multidisciplinary annual surveys (Bourdages *et al.* 2018)
